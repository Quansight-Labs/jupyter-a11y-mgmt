**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**

- #146 This was the beginning of my week. I had some more scheduling participant stuffs. Slowly putting up some issues found during test run ([this is the first example](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/issues/5) and [proposing a template](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/pull/6) so we get similar information from different test-runners who may write these up. Scheduling on-call support if we have assistive tech test-runners can't solve on their own.
- #133. Researching experiences for high-density and document-y UX/UI to gather more ideas. And more sketches (still based on Stephannie's zoom review). I am much more focused on the reflow of the whole space than the details or text resizing at this phase. I need to post some of the ideas on relevant issues. This is still behind where it needs to be.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I think I'm okay at the moment. Just painfully (for me) slow.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here all week.

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- This is a reminder more than needing discussion. I have work on #132 with [draft ideas for a keyboard navigation testing workshop](https://github.com/isabela-pf/a11y-events/pull/8). I don't know if anyone wants to take a look or not since I don't think it's urgent. I would like to schedule a test run, though. Could a future (not next) Monday session be this?

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- Thanks @isabela-pf for taking time to help me work on blog post.

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- Created issue to track my work on [refactoring Tony's testing code](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-testing/issues/13). Due date: this week.
- Tangentially related. Created [pull request #354 against Lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/pull/354) to close [issue #336 to prep docs for v2](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino/issues/336)
- Had chat with Darian about a11y and Lumino.
- Finished investigating [how Windows handles certain zoom issues](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes/issues/34#issuecomment-1216931223) in connection with Stephannie's zoom audit
- Still working on tab traps (this work got a little sidelined by the pace of Lumino v2 work)

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- Hard to find balance between commitment to helping with Lumino v2 versus doing accessibility-specific work. But I think it'll be okay and I'll meet all of my commitments.

**My availability for next week**
- I am out Thursday, August 25 (maybe), Friday, August 26 (definitely), Monday, August 29 (definitely)

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- How to stop worrying and love Lumino v2
