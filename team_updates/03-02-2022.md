## :singer: Individual updates

Thanks I'd like to give 🙌

Thanks to @gabalafou for reminding me about captioning work.
Updates from last week ✔️

SPEC progress. You can find an outline at marsbarlee/specs (some of the draft isn't out there yet)
Grant meeting and proposal progress.
Made PRs from workshop with alt text. Jupyter documentation PR and jupyter.org PR.
Trying to schedule captioners, but no affirmative responses yet.
Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏

Not a challenge, but a question. Does anyone have estimates for how much to pay usability testing participants (I want to compare notes)?
I need ideas for the next Jupyter accessibility workshop sprint. If someone has skills they'd like to offer and could be present during the sprint, the topics are very open. If not, they need to be something I can help troubleshoot.
My availability for next week

I'll be off on February 10 and 11.

Updates from last week ✔️

I've been working on "operationalizing" the work I demo'd last week. By which I mean, making it so that Tony or Tania or Isabela could download the repo and run a few commands and get the same result that I showed last week.
Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏

I really don't have expertise in setting up environments, CI, etc.
My availability for next week

No time off next week
Part of my Quansight allocation is towards the website revamp and we have a kick-off meeting with the agency, Naturaily, on Monday. So I might need to spend a little more time than usual on the website project. We shall see.
