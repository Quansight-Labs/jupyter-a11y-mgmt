Thanks I'd like to give 🙌

Thanks to @gabalafou for working so hard to get oriented in Jupyter spaces. I know there is so much to absorb and even more to try and make sense of. Great work!
Thanks to @tonyfast for always giving me a new perspective on whatever it is I'm working on that week. You really help make my work stronger.
Updates from last week ✔️

Shared updated roadmap Update roadmap November 11 #60 with JupyterLab accessibility call to see how we addressed feedback. I don't think I heard any concern this time.
Roadmap announcement blog has received minor edits based on our team's feedback. If anyone wants to review again, that'd be appreciated.
Put up a PR for search/filter/input fields based on jupyterlab/jupyterlab #8832 for color contrast updates. It is jupyterlab/jupyterlab PR #11658. I've gotten some feedback on this already and need to make changes where I can. I also may need to open some issues for related questions that came up as a result of this discussion.
Started drafting an alt text SPEC with @MarsBarLee. Neither of us have a ton of time to spend here, but I'm excited to keep it moving.
Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏

Some of the feedback on the color contrast PR is outside my knowledge, so I may be asking for resources to learn about that next week.
My availability for next week

I'll be off Thursday and Friday of next week, and then the whole week after that. Please let me know if you need anything from me before then. 🌻
