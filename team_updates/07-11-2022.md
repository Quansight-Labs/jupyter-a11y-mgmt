 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- @isabela-pf for taking care of the blog post improvements 🙏

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- I researched about JupyterLab themes extensions and we should be able to have one extension with multiple themes. Mike told me if it doesn't work, then it is a bug that maybe we need to solve in JupyterLab, we will figure it out once I start to mix it up with more than one theme.
- I'm working in finishing the last themes for `accessible-pygments`, once I finish this I'll make another release.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I'm ok, just having a slow week

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here!

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- I don't have anything for today :)
