I spent most of my time this week trying to fix focus issues in the Lumino MenuBar class (PR forthcoming)

 @isabela-pf 
	* For the Notebook Authoring Guide - needs some work; there are improvements needed in terms of structure
	* Right now, it only seems like it will serve people proactively thinking about accessibility - since it is under "Jupyter", this would need to follow a comprehensive approach
	* Link to Space telescope checklist https://iota-school.github.io/notebooks-for-all/exports/resources/event-hackathon/notebook-authoring-checklist/ ([markdown version](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/blob/main/resources/event-hackathon/notebook-authoring-checklist.md))
	* Idea: maybe it could be reorganised around some principles
	* Idea: contextualise some of the content to make it easier to follow
	* Idea: @gabalafou could lead a sprint/breakout section at Camp Quansight to work on a notebook (or some notebooks) with some of the practices in the authoring notebooks üéâ (some of the [NumPy tutorials are pretty well written](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/))

@gabalafou 
	* Gabriel has been in the focus world now - as a follow-up from his presentation at JupyterCon
	* Reflections from JupyterCon - "intertwining code + narrative" is a very "academic centric" view of notebooks where a lot of folks tend to have laaaarge blocks of code instead
	* Noting that JupyterCon is not entirely representative of the whole population using notebooks
