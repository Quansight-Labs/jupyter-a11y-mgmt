## :singer: Individual updates

- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give üôå** 

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**

- #184 I did another round of recruitment outreach. I'd like to close this up and start scheduling soon, but I'm watching how many potential participants we have to make sure the work isn't cut short.
- I'll share the STScI event resources when I have access to them, but so far they have not been published yet. I'm happy to give you all a rundown upon request.
- Added documentation issues to relevant repos so they can be checked off.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- I don't have anything right now.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here all week. But I am catching up on some other projects and spending time there.

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- I don't have anything right now.

 Two rounds of updates today. First round: "my big update." Second round: full update.

#### Big updates

@isabela-pf 
- My big update: Attended Space Telescope event last week

@steff456 
- My big update: Adding GitHub Light Theme to jupyterlab-accessible-themes
  - One issue: not much variation in syntax highlighting
 
@gabalafou 
- My big update: working towards getting tap trap PR out of draft

#### Longer updates

@isabela-pf 
- Space Telescope event
  - Potential source of recruiting testers, perhaps not for the upcoming testing that we're doing, but future testing.
  - Alt text workshops
  - Opportunities and challenges for combining efforts in notebook authoring recommendations (both disability-specific and not).
    - Caveat: recommendations need to be real-world tested.
  - Generally a lot of enthusiasm (it was an accessibility event)
  - A lot of people with different expertise to follow up with
  - Growing our participant networks
  - Supervisors for this project had positive feedback, encouraged continuing this work, so it seems there is potential for more work here. 
     - This team worked really well for user-testing.

@steff456

- Reviewed alt text description JupyterLab PR
- Docs organization
- SciPy talk w/Isabela accepted
   - Waiting on Quansight Labs now for approval
- Moving to get the GitHub light PR out of draft mode


#### Plans for the next week

@isabela-pf 
Main two things:
1. Move user testing forward. Would like to close interest form, depending on volume of responses. Send out first scheduling emails.
2. Writing up those user testing results (Space Telescope)

@steff456 
1. Writing docs (half day per week)
2. Continue working on GitHub Light theme 
3. Preparing for JupyterCon
