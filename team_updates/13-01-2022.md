**Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**

**Updates from last week ✔️**

It's still been (non-grant) workshop time for me as we come up on the first event.
Started collaborating with community member around notebook user testing with an accessibility focus.
Turns out I already started a roadmap PR on jupyter/accessibility and just forgot. I moved it out of draft mode so you all can review it.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**

I'm okay right now, thanks!
My availability for next week

I will be here all next week, but this and next week is the accessibility workshops. I probably will be spending more time there.

I'm riding a gratitude high from my meditation course, so I appreciate all of you so much right now.

This! https://github.com/gabalafou/map-jupyterlab-frontend-components/blob/main/second-draft.md
It's almost done. There are about four or five more sections to add, and I need to create screenshot for each section, and then I need to run through the document and check that all the links go to the right place.
Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏

None!
