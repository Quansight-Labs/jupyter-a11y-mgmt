 **Things I learned this week**
- You can use GitHub Codespaces to open repos in JupyterLab. This allows you to easily spin up JupyterLab to modify a notebook and then commit those changes directly from the JupyterLab UI because Codespaces includes the [jupyterlab-git](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) extension.

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- Finally submitted my review of an external contributor a11y PR to JupyterLab https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14400#pullrequestreview-1455593106. This took a long time because I haven't done extensive screen reader testing and had to jump through some hoops on my Windows machine. But the win is that I'm in a better place to do this kind of review in the future. Thank goodness for GitPod.
- Took a close look at Tony's PR [the cell is landmark for a form #63](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/pull/63)
- Met with Darian and Tony on Tuesday (recurring Rethinking Notebook Cells meeting) to think about how we can modify the notebook widget to output more accessible HTML for notebook in JupyterLab (and Notebook 7)
- Jumped briefly in triage call to discuss https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/6800. I volunteered to break these into issues.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be off on Monday, June 19

 @gabalafou 
	- discussed review on the alt-text PR (using a screen reader and a PR at the same time)
	- Will be working on splitting `manfromjupyter`'s audit into individual issues, some caveats, and observations from the team
	  - there are a lot of helpful stuff and issues identified, though we do not know how this audit was done 
	  - perhaps we should re-title that issue to sound less prescriptive/absolute in terms of meeting WCAG conformance 

@steff456 
	- the github light PR should be able to be merged
	- next need to make an extension release and add the dark GH theme too  	
	- for the notebook authoring guide recommend reaching out to @melissawm to get input from someone authoring notebooks for the NumPy project

 Notes about the authoring guides

- too long and difficult to follow (Isabela suggested grouping in terms of perceivable...)
- @gabalafou feels this is pretty much following WCAG docs/guides i.e., there is a lot of information, but it does not feel very approachable or focused on end-users (also need to go back to where this needs to live)
- the authoring guide can be contextualised (maybe by putting this into context within notebook examples)

- **@trallard** 

 Reminder doc deliverables

- Audits: zoom and keyboard
- WCAG intro and resources
- user testing results - STSCI and common workflows 
- Notebook authoring guide
