# Weekly update for: 08-08-2022

## :singer: Individual updates

- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- #133. Updated [checklist](https://github.com/quansight-Labs/accessibility/pull/9) based on all y'all's feedback. Tania and Stephannie and I turned them into issues by type and region at [quansight-labs/juptyer-accessible-themes](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes).
- #132 began drafting ideas for a keyboard navigation testing workshop. This isn't legible to any non-@isabela-pf people at this point so I'm not linking it yet. But it's happening after I've put it off far too long.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- We've completed most (if not all) the to dos from the last meeting regarding how to the checklist. I'm not sure where my time is most useful next. With one of the options? With proposing fixes for some of the options? With identifying color issues early? 

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here all week.

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- I don't think I have one at the moment.

- **@isabela-pf** 

 Isabela to do:
- Be ready for more design requests based on Stephannie's audit
- Start mapping color stuffs again so we have that queued up again (low effort, high impact first)
