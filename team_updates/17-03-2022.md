# Weekly update for: 17-03-2022

## :singer: Individual updates

- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give üôå**
- Thanks to all for sticking with this adventure.

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- Once again, very few updates.
- Got a chance to talk more to SPEC people and clarify what they want from the document since we haven't seem aligned. They also have interest in fixing accessibility issues in documentation themes (among other things; just noting for future reference.)
- Preparing for sharing Jupyter accessibility issues with some students next week. Maybe we'll get some new people joining in.
- The final workshop approaches, and that will free me up greatly in terms of time.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- If anyone has Jupyter (not strictly JLab) issues they think would be a good fit/scoped for undergraduate students, I'd love to have them recommended.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be out of office on Monday, March 21. Theoretically, at least.
