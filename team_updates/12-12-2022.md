 **Thanks I'd like to give üôå**
- Really a congratulations, but great work to @steff456 for the collapsible menu PR! I hope it feels awesome seeing that work take shape!

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- #147 Post-test round review. I will be working on writing up issues from this next. Edit: this was voted on here: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/10004#issuecomment-1341247745
- #133 I am the tie breaker. This means, barring further disagreement, we can start following up on @steff456's audit and break up the work as desired.

 **Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- I've been very heads down on getting a PR up for my JupyterLab file browser keyboard focus work. The [code is ready to be submitted as a PR](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/compare/master...gabalafou:jupyterlab:filebrowser-keyboard-focus?expand=1). I just need to finish writing up the description and adding in-line self-review comments.
- Then, I will start writing draft for JupyterCon CFP. My deadline is this coming Monday, December 12.

**My availability for next week**
- I haven't decided which days yet, but I will probably be taking a day or two off around my birthday December 17.

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- What should I work on next after writing JupyterCon proposal? Two ideas:
  1. https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-testing/issues/27
  2. https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/168
