## :singer: Individual updates

- **@isabela-pf**
  
  Thanks I'd like to give 🙌

@gabalafou thank you for being a sounding board for workshop ideas with me!
@tonyfast thanks for supporting the workshops!
@trallard thank you for following up when I ask for help!
Updates from last week ✔️

I don't have much to report.

Opened issue on jupyterlab-fonts about potential JupyterLab settings editor interaction. This extension already provides ways to edit some parts of the theme and is at least somewhat extensible, so I think this could be a good path forward.
Getting in contact with SPEC team about feedback so we can move forward with the current image description draft.
Mostly workshop things. So not helpful here.
Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏

Just a heads-up, I'll be asking for some feedback on one of the workshop formats.
My availability for next week

I'll be here all week.
Important items for discussion 💬
I really like this new section, but I can't think of anything at the moment.
