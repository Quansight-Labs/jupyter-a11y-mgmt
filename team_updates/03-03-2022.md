# Weekly update for: 03-03-2022

## :singer: Individual updates

- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- Just a big thanks to the forces that be that I can work on accessibility at all.

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- I've been spending more time lining things up for the Jupyter accessibility workshop, so I don't have too much to show.
- Checked in about SPEC stuff with collaborator. I think I know what next steps are needed now.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I can't think of anything at the time of typing this.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here all week, just workshop scrambling.
