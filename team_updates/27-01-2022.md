# Weekly update for: 27-01-2022

## :singer: Individual updates

- **@trallard** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give ðŸ™Œ**
-  The whole team for being so helpful and kind

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- Reviews on PR's and general discussions
- Project management in general

**My availability for next week**
-  Will be here all week

Also for discussion:

- [Based on our milestones](https://github.com/orgs/Quansight-Labs/projects/5/views/15) we have quite a few items due for the 6-months milestone - I think now that we have a defined approach (i.e. TDD) we can start marking some as in progress
Please note we *can* move not completed items to the upcoming milestone *12-months* as loads of the goals for that milestone relate to WCAG2.2. alignment and documentation (see https://github.com/orgs/Quansight-Labs/projects/5/views/5)

Also when do you @tonyfast  and @gabalafou  need my CI/CD fu?
