**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**

I made a mistake this week and thought, maybe I'll use Monday and Tuesday to clear some small tasks from my plate, and then those ended up just taking up all my time. So the following bullet points are things I've worked on that are accessibility-related but not directly related to accessibility in Jupyter.

- Good news: Finished upstreaming my changes to `expect-axe-playwright`. Bad news: not sure we'll use it, and it took too much of my time this week.
- https://github.com/Widen/expect-axe-playwright/pull/24. Finished this PR, which felt like doing a little bit of public service. The aim here was to prevent unintentionally spreading the idea among developers that there's an automated tool out there that can stamp your page or app as "accessible" or not.
- https://github.com/Widen/expect-axe-playwright/pull/23. Finished this PR. It will allow us to stop using my fork of expect-axe-playwright. 
- https://github.com/Quansight/Quansight-website/pull/262. Worked some more on adding Pa11y-CI to the Quansight website. Discovered more obstacles, specifically the default configuration for Axe flags a bunch of elements on the site for contrast that might not have contrast issues. These elements either have a background image or otherwise overlap some other element, and for some reason, that makes Axe incapable of ascertaining the foreground/background contrast ratio. So I'm going to have to hide a bunch of elements during testing in order to get the site to pass the CI/CD run or figure out a way to configure Axe differently.

**My availability for next week**
- I am taking Monday off.
