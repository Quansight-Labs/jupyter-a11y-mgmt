- Update the [JupyterLab accessibility project board](https://github.com/orgs/Quansight-Labs/projects/5/views/1)
- Determine pathways for inviting community engagement

### Coming soon

- Improve color contrast in JupyterLab ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum))
- Support for 400% zoom in JupyterLab ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#reflow))
- Cross-project outreach within Project Jupyter and beyond
- Add a news section to the [jupyter-a11y-mgmt team compass](https://quansight-labs.github.io/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/readme.html)

### Not too far off

- Support full-interface keyboard navigability in JupyterLab ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard-accessible))
- JupyterLab documentation accessibility audit (manual and automated tests)
- Update JupyterLab documentation to cover accessibility features added to JupyterLab
- Update JupyterLab contributing guidelines to include accessibility considerations

## What is this?

Welcome! You've found your way to the public roadmap for Jupyter accessibility efforts that fall in scope of the [CZI EOSS grant Inclusive and Accessible Computing in the Jupyter Ecosystem](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/inclusive-and-accessible-scientific-computing-in-the-jupyter-ecosystem/).

This roadmap's content is derived from
- [The original grant proposal](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/blob/master/grant-applications/Inclusive_and_Accessible_Scientific_Computing_in_Jupyter_Ecosystem_SUBMITTED_PROPOSAL.pdf)
- The [jupyter-a11y-mgmt repository's planning issues](https://github.com/orgs/Quansight-Labs/projects/5/views/1) 
- The [JupyterLab accessibility project board](https://github.com/orgs/Quansight-Labs/projects/5/views/1)
- Feedback from community members working on accessibility

## Join in

Does one of the above items interest you? Do you have accessibility knowledge that you'd like to share? This work takes place across multiple open-source projects and repositories, so [jupyter-a11y-mgmt's contributing guide](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) might be a good place to start.

Stay up to date: 
- This roadmap will be updated periodically
