Q: are we thinking of having an intern this summer?
- yes, it would be good to have another intern this summer
- we have a few specific tasks that an intern could take on, and we also have a lot of documentation work to do (can look into communities like Write the docs)

Aside: we should organise an internal documentation sprint and commit to paying our docs debt.
