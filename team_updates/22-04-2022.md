# Weekly update for: 22-04-2022

## :singer: Individual updates

- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- Thanks for @gabalafou's hopefulness. It keeps me going many a day.

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- Continued #95. Mapped [axe-core rules](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/rule-descriptions.md#best-practices-rules) on to the [work in progress spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mUmZevaEI1HwZQ0uF5Rjhb9mGEJ71RAkjj-Lxr3sLZw/edit?usp=sharing) to track what tests we get from the start (in relation to WCAG, though note we get a lot of "best practice" ones that are fantastic and not on the list). I also marked the WCAG areas I would like to prioritize coming up with our own tests for based on importance to JLab and how testable they seem to me. Also started listing ideas for JLab "pages" to test, and have some questions to bring up in this meeting.
-  The [voting to determine where jupyter/accessibility will be within Jupyter governance](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/issues/81) (at least for now) is done. I'm not 100% sure how to move forward, but I do know who I can reach out to to ask. Is there anything else we want to check on here?
- I've been working on PRs to reorganize the image description guidelines I was trying to contribute as a SPEC ([SPEC PR](https://github.com/isabela-pf/specs/pull/2/files), [supporting website PR](https://github.com/isabela-pf/accessibility.scientific-python.org/pull/1/), both work-in-progress). I bring this up because I think a derivative of this could help in #93 and I plan to add it later.
- Oh, I also replied to #97 per request. I almost forgot because I've just accepted the proposed timeline in my brain so easily! 😆 

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- Minus feel scattered, I think I'm surviving.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be out of office on April 22 and 25 to spend some time at [this workshop](https://disabilityjusticeinhci.org/#schedule) and then recover from extended human interaction. 🙃 I hope to have some cool ideas to share with you all when I'm back.

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- Questions about #95 JupyterLab "pages" to run. This could also be done asynchronously if we need to discuss other things.
