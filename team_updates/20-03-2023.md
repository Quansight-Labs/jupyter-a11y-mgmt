# Weekly update for: 20-03-2023

## :singer: Individual updates

- **@steff456** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- Thanks to all for reviewing again the GSoD proposal

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- Worked in the GSoD proposal 
    - Added the latest comments
    - I think it is ready for upload!
- Worked in the themes extension
    - I changed the focus on how I was approaching the problem to first worry about the structure and distribution of the package before doing any actual change in color. 
    - Opened an issue in Jupyterlab because the current themes API doesn't have a way to have one package or plugin that includes multiple themes - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/14202

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I'm ok!

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- Is there anything else the GSoD proposal needs? I think it is in a good place to upload it and submit it.
- There's a way to embed multiple plugins into one, so I'll continue working towards that route.
