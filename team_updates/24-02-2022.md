## :singer: Individual updates

- **@gabalafou**

Thanks I'd like to give 🙌

You are all such lovely people and I am grateful to get to work with you
Updates from last week ✔️

No updates. Been working hard on Conda Store. I plan on devoting the rest of this week and much of next week to making progress here.
Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏

I'm aware of the draft JEP from Eric, but I haven't really dug into it yet. Can we discuss this in our team meeting?
Something that I brought up in yesterday's JupyterLab Accessibility Meeting - do we want to use some of the time at the next meeting to brainstorm ideas for how we want to use the jupyter/accessibility repo? I'm particularly interested in hearing from other devs who have worked in the JupyterLab codebase on accessibility - what would they find useful?
My availability for next week

I'm available all next week!
