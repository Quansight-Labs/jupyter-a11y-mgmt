# Weekly update for: 06-01-2022

## :singer: Individual updates

- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- Thanks to @gabalafou and @trallard for keeping things running while I was out!

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- I haven't gotten to work on anything since the [the last check in](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/69#issuecomment-1000001393). It's been (non-grant) workshop time for me.
- Reached out to a community member who contacted me about potential user research around accessibility. This is still in the air, but it may come back later. Here's your heads up!

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I think I need to figure out a better way to make UI changes with JupyterLab. My current approach feels like it's harder than is helpful and I'm getting frustrated. I don't think I need any help yet.

**My availability for next week**
- I will be here all next week, but next week is also the first accessibility workshop. I probably will be spending more time in that headspace.
