## :singer: Individual updates

- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌** 

Thanks to @trallard for all her effort finishing up testing logistics!

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**

- #184 We are in the results writing phase! I'm still aiming for a PR this week, but it's feeling less possible by the second. Regardless, a lot has been written this week. I think all test logistics are finally done.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I don't have anything right now.

**My availability for next week**
- I will be out of office.

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- Are we making a 1.0 (or whatever numbering) release for [Quansight-Labs/JupyterLab-user-testing](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/JupyterLab-user-testing)?
