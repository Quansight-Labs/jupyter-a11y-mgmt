- Stephannie gets my thanks for powering through theming obstacles!

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**

- #133 preparing for the next decision making step. I'm trying to figure out what I need to get this in a vote-able state.
- [accessible-pygments blog post](https://github.com/quansight/quansight-website/pull/527) is updated and maybe ready to go? I'm not sure if Stephannie has an addition.
- Space Telescope check in was this week, so there are notes and some repo custodial work I posted as I am ramping up to the second round of user testing. This is more for your awareness than anything else.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I'm okay.

**My availability for next week**

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**

Add tasks to this repo:

- https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/167
- https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/170
- https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/168
- https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/169

I'm working on #167 but this week has been a bit slow. I still can't figure out why the body element receives focus on tab. I messaged the JupyterLab channel on Gitter, but so far no response.

I also gave [Kulsoom's blog post](https://github.com/Quansight/Quansight-website/pull/537) another round of review. It's almost done!

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- Making GitHub actions do what I want 

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- Check in: do the tasks I added make sense? Is this what I should be working on?
