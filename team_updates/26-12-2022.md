 @gabalafou 
- Working on review so far this week, next steps are PR work
- No support currently needed

@steff456 
- Working between hamburger menu and zoom sidebar issues
- Needs @isabela-pf to make design decisions on the sidebar issues
- Can move to theming extensions if needed, so no blockers yet.

@isabela-pf 
- Add timeline to user testing issue and begin listing tasks so we can split them where possible.
