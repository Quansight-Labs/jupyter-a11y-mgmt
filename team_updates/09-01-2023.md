- **@trallard** 

 @gabalafou 
 - still working on tab traps in JupyterLab (as per usual, this turned out to be more of a lift than expected)
 - discussed: workflow on opening GH issues for JupyterLab work - whatever approach @gabalafou  feels the most comfortable with

@isabela-pf 
- for the user testing round: we discussed a general workflow (standard tasks) to see how users respond and what blockers they encounter
- [email template](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/blob/main/user-tests/0-support/outreach-email-template.md) for @trallard  do some outreach - we discussed trying to find folks who are already familiar with JupyterLab
