 **Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- Submitted [3 PRs to expect-axe-playwright](https://github.com/Widen/expect-axe-playwright/issues/21#issuecomment-1211764654)
- Had chat with Tony about [Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-testing](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-testing). Plan: I am going to try to make it look more like conventional doit.py code, more like the [dodo.py file in jupyter/accessibility](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/blob/main/dodo.py) that Nick Bollweg wrote. If that works, then we will tackle next steps defined in the issues in that repo. Question: where should I create an issue to track this?
- I volunteered to take on a few [Lumino 2 issues](https://github.com/orgs/jupyterlab/projects/4), which could help us get some accessibility fixes in (i.e., tab traps)
- I hoped to have my PR up for tab traps in Lumino. Almost there, should have it up tomorrow.
- Reviewed and commented [Stephannie's summary of her audit of zoom in JupyterLab](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes/issues/34)

**Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- @tonyfast for taking the time to chat with me and expand my mind

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I need to write a blog post, but every time I think about it my mind feels like mush 😱. Does somebody want to brainstorm ideas with me?
- Besides providing another brain for reviewing and bouncing ideas, is there something I should be doing for accessibility theme extension.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here!
