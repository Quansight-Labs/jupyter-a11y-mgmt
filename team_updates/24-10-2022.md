**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- I worked in the [blogpost](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11npNB1DcUbax2h3dYIfX-DYH7TKGP4fjyBalvnXYN-g/edit), now it is almost ready, I still need to work in a gif with the themes to add it.
- I added six new themes to the accessibility-pygments repo. I still have two themes to fully support vscode recommended themes - [tracking issue](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessible-pygments/issues/2)

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I'm ok

**My availability for next week**

**Important items for discussion 💬**

- **@gabalafou** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- Big thanks to @kulsoomzahra for all of the good energy and hard work put into the internship these past three months!

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- I mostly got all of the pieces in place for my accessibility regression test demo. A lot of polishing and cleaning up to do next. I need to open some PRs now.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I need to have a 1-on-1 with Frederic or someone from JupyterLab to ask some questions about things I don't understand. For example, why do they use `git merge-base pull_request.base.sha pull_request.head.sha`? Why can't they just use the the base SHA as the base and the head SHA as the head? 
 
**My availability for next week**
- I don't plan on taking off any time next week; however, I have a cousin coming to visit me and we might be in a small town on Monday and Tuesday, so my wifi might be a bit spotty on those days.

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- Can we discuss next steps for accessibility regression tests?

- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- #133 got feedback on mockups in [JupyterLab #10004](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/10004) in the JupyterLab and JupyterLab accessibility calls.
- #132 the keyboard navigation event is being turned into an issue for jupyter/notebook I have a draft of it open literally as I type this update 😆. I will finish it after this call.
- Worked on accessible-pygments blog post with Stephannie. I'll be turning it to a PR by the end of this week.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I'm surviving.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here all next week.

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- I don't think I have anything right now.

- **@trallard** 

 @isabela-pf 
  - got some feedback from the accessibility call on the zoom proposal
  - do we need to have interviews with low-vision users? what do we want to get out of this? perhaps we need to look at what they'd expect rather than specific to JLab?
  - what apps would we look at to compare? - @isabela-pf  can work on a checklist, and we can "audit" different apps
