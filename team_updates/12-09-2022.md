 **Thanks I'd like to give üôå**

- @steff456 thank you for cheering me on!

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**

- #146. Reviewed all six tests, solidified takeaways and bugs, and split issue writing between myself and the other designer. I'm working on writing out all my section now, so this is very work in progress. Here are our [early findings as issues](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22test+1%3A+navigation%22) are tagged by test 1.
- #133. Per request, I followed up with a more [in-depth issue on the open tab navigation in high zoom in JupyterLab](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes/issues/36). Let me know if that is still missing anything. 
- Got answers about what needs to be done for Jupyter accessibility governance. I'll be posting more info on the jupyter/accessibility's relevant issue. 
- Update (but not by my own merit): [alt text SPEC restructuring was merged](https://github.com/scientific-python/specs/pull/134)! Many thanks are due! There's still more to be done in terms of documenting alt text findings, but I thought the update might be nice since I haven't mentioned it in a while.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- I'll survive.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here all next week.

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- I don't know the status of the [JupyterLab area reflow proposals](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes/issues/34#issuecomment-1228911639) to help move those along. Please let me know if I'm missing something.
