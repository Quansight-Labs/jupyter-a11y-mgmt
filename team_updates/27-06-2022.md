# Weekly update for: 27-06-2022

## :singer: Individual updates

- **@gabalafou** 

 As I mentioned in the last update, this week I took a break from CZI work to focus on the website. The only thing I would like to do this week related to CZI is to try to upstream my fork of expect-axe-playwright, which we discussed on Monday.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be available all next week.
