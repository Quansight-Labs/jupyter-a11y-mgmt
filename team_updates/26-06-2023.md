- For next week I'll bring a plan per week for the internship

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- What is missing in https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/126 to be merged?
- Anyone has the bandwidth to finish Mike PR? He said he would be super happy to see that work moving, but I wanted to check the priorities with the team.
- Should I wait for Github dark before doing the release of jupyterlab accessible themes? Or should I go ahead and do the release as it is?
