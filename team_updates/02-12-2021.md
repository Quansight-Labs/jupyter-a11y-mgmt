## :singer: Individual updates

Thanks I'd like to give 🙌

Thanks to @gabalafou for helping me fix my (apparently quite broken) JupyterLab development environment. 🌻
Updates from last week ✔️

Started to update roadmap Update roadmap November 11 #60 (from the Source HackMD first) based on community meetings' feedback. Haven't put the updates in the PR yet. (So draft roadmap blog post will need updates too.)
Started experimenting with search/filter/input fields based on jupyterlab/jupyterlab #8832 for color contrast updates. I may do a draft PR today, but I am still trying to find a way to make all the search buttons match.
Checked in with Mars about SPEC work. I think this will be a chance for at least some of the documentation/sharing with other projects. Since we (Mars, Tony, and I) have done a multiple alt text documentation sprints with projects, we think that might be a good place to start.
Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏

I am okay for now.
My availability for next week

I'll be here all next week. ✨
