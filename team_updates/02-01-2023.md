# Weekly update for: 02-01-2023

## :singer: Individual updates

- **@gabalafou** 

 **Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- I worked towards deliverable: https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/168
  - Per usual, this turned out to be way more complicated than I expected. There are a lot of layers in the notebook area. And a lot of keyboard shortcuts are already bound in ways I wasn't expecting.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- I might need to get some help on #168. There's so many moving parts. I know at the very least it would be helpful for me to talk through the options with somebody else.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be off tomorrow on Friday, December 30.
- I'll be traveling Tuesday, January 3 (but working from plane).
