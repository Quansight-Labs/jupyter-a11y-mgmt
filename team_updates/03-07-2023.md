**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- I'm ok

**My availability for next week**
- I'm here

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- Do we want the intern to be in our sync meetings? Or should we only invite him to the group a11y meeting?
- I still don't have any reply for external feedback about the notebook authoring guidelines, I need to do some thinking to see how we can move that PR to something that we want to have in the docs
- @gabalafou do you want to be maintainer in PyPI as well? If so, please send me your PyPI username

 **Thanks I'd like to give üôå** 

Thanks to the whole team for their patience with me as I get back to the project.

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**

- #184 I picked up writing the results again this week. Still aiming for an end of week PR.
- #147 The [second test results](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/blob/main/user-tests/2-content/results.md) and [test 3 planning](https://github.com/Iota-School/notebooks-for-all/blob/main/user-tests/3-cell_structure/planning.md) (tests not run) were reviewed and merged. This means I just need to link to these results elsewhere in the ecosystem to finish the project.
- #173 picked up the [jupyter/accessibility #127 for notebook authoring practices](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/127) to give another review based on verbal feedback. This is still in progress.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- I don't have anything right now.

**My availability for next week**
- I will be here all week.

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- I want to check in on my next steps with everyone else to make sure I didn't miss and direction changes in the meantime. Please let me know if I'm blocking you.

- **@gabalafou** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give üôå**
- I think I might have already said thanks for this somewhere else, but thanks again anyway to @trallard and @steff456 for helping me brainstorm the cell focus styling issue for my notebook tab trap PR. I finally responded to review comments on that PR.
- Thanks to @isabela-pf for pushing back against my "command palette as skip link" idea. Critique is critical to making better decisions. Your feedback is very much welcome and appreciated.

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- Created issue #225
- Created issue https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/14765
- Created draft PR https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14768
- Finished review and helped push fix to https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14597
- Finally responded to review comments on https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/14115

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- I'm not sure I can handle this many different things at once in Jupyter land. 
  - I want to give some love to the [Google doc that T & P created](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m5-fiqWVdlqOuKjp4auakG0MMaTii7JdCVyjwKU7uQU/edit)
  - Also want to give some love to https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/6800
- Reviewing the accessibility PRs has been so much more time-consuming than I expected.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be off tomorrow, Friday, June 30.
- I will be here all next week.

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- Somebody at QuantStack will be working on keyboard navigation issues. (I think this is specifically targeted at Notebook 7, but certainly some it will have to be done in JupyterLab.)

 Notes:

@isabela-pf 
- she's back!
- writing up more results from JupyterLab user testing, stretch goal: end of week pr
- will be submitting PRs to create links to the STScI work - because grant deliverable has two parts: 1. make results public 2. link to results
- wondering if anything happened during Camp Quansight with creating an accessibility notebook; whether any thing happened there that needs to be taken into account for the grant documentation deliverable

 @steff456 
	- Stephannie reached out to a couple of people individually; we need to try and do an "open" call at Quansight to reach out to folks
	- the checklist seems usable to verify/audit notebooks rather than being a resource that folks could use to write better or more accessible notebooks
	- need to debug the build and release of jupyterlab-accessible-themes
	- internship plan looks good - suggestion to try Gitpod for docs if needing to avoid setting a development environment
	- will work on fixing issues in https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-accessible-themes/issues/56

@gabalafou 
	- will focus on the grant deliverables 
	- was planning to work on ARIA improvements for notebooks; this will be put on hold in favour of grant deliverables
	- got back to his TAB trap PR
