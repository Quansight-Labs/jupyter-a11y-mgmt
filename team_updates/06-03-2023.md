 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- @isabela-pf for creating Google doc to put down our goals through the end of the grant.

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- I worked towards deliverable: https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/168. I know I said I would have the PR up before now, but I kept running into little issues and playing whack-a-mole. I promise this is going up today as PR against the JupyterLab repo.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- This PR isn't getting attention and has a merge conflict with master yet again: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/13577

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here!

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- Nothing from me today.
