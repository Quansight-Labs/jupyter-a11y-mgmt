## :singer: Individual updates

- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give üôå**
- Thanks to @tonyfast for the continued Jupyter expertise! I am so grateful I can always ask you where to look for info!

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- [quansight-labs/accessibility #3 accessibility statement](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessibility/pull/3) has been updated. I think it's ready for merge, unless I missed something. 
- [jupyter/accessibility #95 testing script documentation](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/95) has been opened. 
- #93 [jupyter/accessibility #94 accessibility workshop to community docs](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/94) has been opened.
- Collected all our [alt text events](https://github.com/isabela-pf/a11y-events/tree/main/workshop-resources/alt-text#past-events) so we can reference them easily. Kinda of relates to #32.
- #128 has a PR at #137 now. Please review since I'm giving it my best guess.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- Does the [draft accessibility statement](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessibility/pull/3) need more changes? I think I've addressed almost all the feedback, but I'm not sure what to do to finish this.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be out of office on June 10.
- I'll also be out a little later this month, just an early heads up.

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- Can we all review the roadmap changes? They're short so it won't be much of your time; I want to be sure I'm representing y'all accurately.

- Muchas gracias for your patience, all of you.

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- I was out last week, nothing done on my end
- Other than the meeting we had Monday with lots of good discussion, I've given the grant no time so far this week.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- Website is full steam ahead, but there's no assistance to solve that issue.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be available all next week.

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- Next work cycle

     - fixes on [jupyter/accessibility #90](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/90) based on feedback
     - trying to use [jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts) for tests and exploring for theming work

Need to do
- [ ] [jupyter/accessibility #90](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/90) should be polished. Time for reviewing/merging?
- [ ] Remove `draft` from accessibility statement and add a message describing what it means. Then open draft PR to jupyter/accessibility
