- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- Thanks to everyone for their patience while I work far more on the Jupyter accessibility workshops this week!

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- Roadmap #60 has been merged. I put in a draft PR for this to be in the jupyter/accessibility repo: [jupyter/accessibility #64](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/64).
- Roadmap announcement blog hasn't changed since [last week](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/65#issuecomment-995962177).
- Updated the PR for search/filter/input fields color contrast ([jupyterlab/jupyterlab PR #11658](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/11658)). All changes are based on the feedback, but there are some other larger questins still unaddressed. This is ready for another round of review if wanted.
- Continued drafting the alt text [SPEC](https://scientific-python.org/) with @MarsBarLee. This week we worked on scope, style guide, and main alt text writing principles.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- Things are okay, thanks!

**My availability for next week**
- I will be out of office until January 3. 😴 Time for a nap!
