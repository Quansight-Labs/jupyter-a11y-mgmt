 **Thanks I'd like to give üôå**
- Many thanks to @isabela-pf for helping me think through UX questions!

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- #182 - Same as last week: I've been heads down on this issue. PR forthcoming. Sneak peek of code changes can be seen here: https://github.com/gabalafou/jupyterlab/compare/fix-focus-visible...file-browser-focus?expand=1

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- This UX work is difficult because I have to make decisions. Isabela has been helping me think through these.
  - Example: the "go up" command is registered on the filename node class. But this means that when the directory is empty, go back fails. So should I get rid of the command and handle the backspace key in the class?

**My availability for next week**
- Here.

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- Axe-con

 **Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- I'm still working on the hamburger menu, found an issue with Lumino examples where I was testing the changes in the menu bar. I need to test it against Jupyterlab to see if I'm able to track the new features that I'm adding. The tasks I'll focus on:
   - Open an issue in Lumino with the issue I found in the examples
   - Test my changes with jupyterlab
- I started checking the template for the talks in Jupytercon, but I'm not sure in which category should the talk/poster go. Maybe **community** ?

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**

**My availability for next week**
