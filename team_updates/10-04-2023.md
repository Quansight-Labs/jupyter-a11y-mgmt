**My availability for next week**
- I'll out of office from April 11‚Äì15. I may respond to some things but will mostly be away from my computer for event things.

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- Is there anything I'm blocking anyone on before I'm out for a few days? I'd like to get that resolved if needed.
