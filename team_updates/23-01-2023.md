# Weekly update for: 23-01-2023

## :singer: Individual updates

- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- #184 Set up logistic documents and structure for running and recording user testing info. I'm not linking it because this information does need to be private.
- #184 For the same topic, I also narrowed testing plans down to two possible task lists. The first draft of the script is started, but dependent on testing plan direction.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I don't think I have anything now.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be out of office on Monday the 23rd.

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- I'd like to check if the draft script tasks make sense with the team, especially from the perspective of people with more knowledge in common with our testing audience. I'd also like to know if anything seems missing. This can be done in this meeting if we have time, or separately.
