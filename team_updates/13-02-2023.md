 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- Thank you all for talking with me and bouncing ideas!

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- Fixed a nasty merge conflict to update my open PR on jupyterlab repo: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/13577
- I think I found a way to get past what was blocking me on https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/168. See important discussion below.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- Just tab traps, and you are all helping me by talking through it with me.

**My availability for next week**
- 🎭 I'll be off one week for Carnaval! Wednesday, February 15 through Wednesday, February 22. So last day I will be in office is on Tuesday, February 14. Then out. Then back in office on Thursday, February 23. It's on the calendar (I just double checked).

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- How to bump my one open JupyterLab PR for attention? https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/13577
- What to do with https://github.com/gabalafou/jupyterlab/pull/18? This PR is currently on my fork, but I want to put it on JupyterLab, but it might break things.

 @isabela-pf 
	- Isabela - will work on the test scripts tomorrow
	- notebook authoring recommendations STScI will be in their repository - complimentary to their style guide (if possible - can you share, please?)
	- @gabalafou are we thinking of adding this to JLab? -> maybe at Jupyter-level docs since people use and write notebooks in many contexts -> ideally somewhere with high visibility/discoverability

@gabalafou 
	- 🎉 managed to solve a horrendous merge conflict on his opened Focus PR 🎉 
	-  Conclusions from the a11y call and the Shortcuts discussion -> this is a mess y'all!
	- Tab trap world problem:
		- Best UX - wherever you are on the notebook, the keyboard shortcuts should still work
		- Issue - if any widget inside the notebook uses any of the same shortcuts as the notebook, this gets overshadowed by the notebook-level shortcuts  	
	- Will be sharing his PR https://github.com/gabalafou/jupyterlab/pull/18 soon
	- small discussion on whether the cells should be tab focusable -> Gabriel proposes having only one cell focusable at a time
	- 💡 command palette focus and up/down

@steff456 
	- fix pygments today/tomorrow
	- and finish the hamburger menu
