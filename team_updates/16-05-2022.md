# Weekly update for: 16-05-2022

## :singer: Individual updates

- **@isabela-pf** 

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- #3 Finished up turning vague event ideas to rough draft agendas for easier critique. [Rough agendas are listed on this issue](https://github.com/isabela-pf/a11y-events/issues/4#issuecomment-1124536984).
- Followed up on jupyter/accessibility governance voting, so it's moving forward. [Here is the relevant PR on jupyter/governance](https://github.com/jupyter/governance/pull/129) (I did not make the PR, so thank @/afshin).
- Not strictly grant-related, but you may be interested in me finally getting [a blog draft up about some accessibility review](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/quansight-labs-site/pull/324). I'm not sure if this would support anything anyone's working on.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- I think I'm okay at the moment.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be around all week.

**Important items for discussion 💬**
- I think we didn't get to what @tonyfast mentioned wanting to discuss on Monday, so I wanted to check if he wanted to circle back now.
- Can we review the final decision on #120? I think I know what's happening, but I saw a little more discussion post-closure.

 **Thanks I'd like to give 🙌**
- Big thanks to @trallard for PR review

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- Since last meeting, most of my time has been spent on [getting the axe-core tests working on Gitpod](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/83)
- My next steps are to implement @isabela-pf's human-readable tests

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with 🙏**
- See important items for discussion below

**My availability for next week**
- Out for CAMP QUANSIGHT May 16-18 (Monday-Wednesday)
  
**Important items for discussion 💬**
- I opened a discussion around [user stories for testing](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/discussions/122)
- We are behind the original schedule. I was thinking that at this point, we would:
  - Have a Github workflow in place to run tests against a JupyterLab commit
  - Be close to merging 1-2 code translations of Isabela's human readable tests into jupyter/accessibility

  - SciPy alt-text sprint 
  - To reiterate -> we will use the proposed workflow in #120 (PRs immediately against our Quansight-labs fork
 
- @tonyfast 
  - showed a demo of doit and wrapper - needs to open PR and clean code 
  - need to document and define what the developer workflow works 
  - to sync with @gabalafou  to see how this work fits into the broader picture
