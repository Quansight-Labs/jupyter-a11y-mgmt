**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- I worked towards deliverable: [Transfer testing scripts into Playwright](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/112)

I was at Camp Quansight this week, so I don't have too much in terms of updates.

1. I translated 1 of the human-readable test scripts into a Playwright script: https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessibility/pull/2
2. Tony and I had a pairing session at Camp Quansight. I showed him the [Gitpod work](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/83) and he showed me his [doit work](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/pull/84)

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- Nothing at the moment

**My availability for next week**
### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Important
- I will be traveling for part of Tuesday and Wednesday (May 24-25) next week, and then I will be on a cruise boat the following week (May 30-June 3).

**Updates from last week :heavy_check_mark:**
- [#52 accessibility statements (comment)](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-a11y-mgmt/issues/52#issuecomment-1127886714). Add some thoughts and a draft statement that needs amending. There is now [a PR version for review](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/accessibility/pull/3).
- Attended the [JupyterLab Code Mirror 6 migration meeting](https://youtu.be/Jtl7mLP1LKU). I don't think I have a ton to report, but I'm happy to answer questions. This will likely impact our work, and one of the multiple reasons to migrate to Code Mirror 6 is its accessibility support.
- [jupyter/jupyter #607 alt text contribution](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/pull/607). Following up on this PR to try and get it merged. Does anyone know about [how the Sphinx `figure` directive gets parsed and how it might interact with assistive tech](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/pull/607#discussion_r876532987)? It sounds like this might still be picked up as a description and be functional, but I can't find any evidence and I don't have a good example to investigate.

My next steps will to be to open PRs I've been waiting to open. That will move a few different issues on this repo forward.

**Challenges I faced and things I'd like assistance with üôè**
- I'm feeling "where is everything?" repo confusion, but I don't think there's anything to be done. Y'all don't need to do anything.

**My availability for next week**
- I'll be here all next week.

**Important items for discussion üí¨**
- I don't think I have anything that needs immediate discussion this week. Thanks.
